rec.py is the pogram that listens

Configure the pin within the file INPUT_WIRE = 12
to match the pin (physical pin number, not the GPIO) number.

recoriginal.py is the original rec file. Archive and should not be modified for backup reasons.

ShowRAW also needs pin to be rewritten if the pin changes.
ShowRAW shows individual bytes as they are recognised.


outputexample.txt is an example of a recorded button press as outcome of doing "python rec.py >> ./output.txt"
